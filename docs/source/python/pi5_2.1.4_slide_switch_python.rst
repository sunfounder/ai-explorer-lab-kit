2.1.4 Slide Switch
==============================================

**Introduction**

In this project, we will learn how to use a slide switch to control two LEDs. Slide switches are commonly used as power switches in electronic circuits. Here, we demonstrate its functionality using a breadboard setup. While slide switches are often soldered onto PCBs for stability, we will use it in a flexible breadboard configuration to better understand its operation.

**Circuit Diagram**

The Slide Switch middle pin is connected to GPIO17, while two LEDs are connected to GPIO22 and GPIO27. The switch toggles between the two LEDs, alternately lighting them up.

----------------------------------------------

**Wiring Diagram**

Follow these steps to build the circuit:

1. Connect the middle pin of the Slide Switch to GPIO17.
2. Connect one side pin of the Slide Switch to GND and the other to VCC.
3. Connect LED1â€™s anode to GPIO22 via a current-limiting resistor.
4. Connect LED2â€™s anode to GPIO27 via a current-limiting resistor.
5. Connect the cathodes of both LEDs to GND.

----------------------------------------------

**Writing the Code**

Hereâ€™s the Python code to control the LEDs based on the state of the Slide Switch:

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   from gpiozero import LED, Button  # Import LED and Button classes for GPIO control
   from time import sleep  # Import sleep function for adding delays

   # Initialize the slide switch on GPIO pin 17 with the pull-up resistor disabled
   slide_switch = Button(17, pull_up=False)
   # Initialize LED1 on GPIO pin 22
   led1 = LED(22)
   # Initialize LED2 on GPIO pin 27
   led2 = LED(27)

   try:
       # Main loop to control LED states based on the slide switch's state
       while True:
           if slide_switch.is_pressed:  # Check if the slide switch is activated
               print('    LED1 ON    ')  # Print status message
               led1.on()   # Turn on LED1
               led2.off()  # Turn off LED2
           else:  # If the slide switch is not activated
               print('    LED2 ON    ')  # Print status message
               led1.off()  # Turn off LED1
               led2.on()   # Turn on LED2

           sleep(0.5)  # Wait for 0.5 seconds before rechecking the switch state

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       # Handle a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) for a clean exit from the loop
       pass


This Python script demonstrates the use of a slide switch to control two LEDs on a Raspberry Pi. When executed:

1. **Slide Switch Activated**:

   - Prints "LED1 ON" to the console.
   - Turns on LED1 (connected to GPIO pin 22).
   - Turns off LED2 (connected to GPIO pin 27).

2. **Slide Switch Not Activated**:

   - Prints "LED2 ON" to the console.
   - Turns off LED1.
   - Turns on LED2.

3. The program continuously checks the state of the slide switch every 0.5 seconds and adjusts the LEDs accordingly.

4. The script runs indefinitely until interrupted by pressing ``Ctrl+C``.



----------------------------------------------

**Understanding the Code**

1. **Library Imports**

   Import necessary libraries for GPIO control and adding delays.

   .. code-block:: python

       from gpiozero import LED, Button
       from time import sleep

2. **Component Initialization**

   Configure the Slide Switch as a Button and initialize two LEDs connected to GPIO pins 22 and 27.

   .. code-block:: python

       slide_switch = Button(17, pull_up=False)
       led1 = LED(22)
       led2 = LED(27)

3. **State Monitoring and LED Control**

   In the main loop, the program monitors the state of the Slide Switch. When the switch is toggled, it alternates between turning on LED1 and LED2.

   .. code-block:: python

       while True:
           if slide_switch.is_pressed:
               led1.on()
               led2.off()
           else:
               led1.off()
               led2.on()
           sleep(0.5)

4. **Graceful Exit**

   The script terminates gracefully when interrupted using Ctrl+C.

   .. code-block:: python

       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           pass


----------------------------------------------

**Troubleshooting**


1. **Slide Switch Does Not Respond**  

   - **Cause**: The slide switch is not connected properly, or the pull-up resistor configuration is incorrect.  
   - **Solution**: Confirm that the slide switch is connected to GPIO pin 17 and ground. Ensure ``pull_up=False`` matches the active-low switch configuration.


2. **LEDs Flicker or Behave Erratically**  

   - **Cause**: Debounce issues with the slide switch.  
   - **Solution**: Add software debounce to stabilize the input signal:

   .. code-block:: python

      if slide_switch.is_pressed:
         sleep(0.05)  # Debounce delay

----------------------------------------------

**Extendable Ideas**


1. **Two-Way Switch Control**  

   Combine two slide switches to control LEDs in a more complex setup, such as a simple light control panel.


2. **Audio Feedback**  

   Add a buzzer that sounds when the slide switch is activated:

   .. code-block:: python

      from gpiozero import Buzzer
      buzzer = Buzzer(23)
      if slide_switch.is_pressed:
         buzzer.on()
      else:
         buzzer.off()


3. **PWM Brightness Control**  

   Use a PWMLED to adjust the brightness of an LED based on the slide switch's state:

   .. code-block:: python

      from gpiozero import PWMLED
      led1 = PWMLED(22)
      if slide_switch.is_pressed:
         led1.value = 0.8  # 80% brightness
      else:
         led1.value = 0.2  # 20% brightness


----------------------------------------------


**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how to use a Slide Switch with a Raspberry Pi to control LEDs. Slide Switches are versatile and durable components, often employed in user interfaces and control systems. Experimenting with them opens up possibilities for creating advanced and interactive projects.
