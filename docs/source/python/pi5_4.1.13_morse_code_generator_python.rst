4.1.13 Morse Code Generator
===========================

**Introduction**

In this project, we will create a Morse code generator using a Raspberry Pi. You can input a series of characters via the terminal, and the system will output the corresponding Morse code signals using a buzzer and an LED. This project not only demonstrates basic GPIO control but also introduces Morse code, a fascinating communication method used historically for telegraphy.

----------------------------------------------

**Writing the Code**

1. Navigate to the code directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd ~/zero-w-ai-kit/python

2. Run the script:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo python3 4.1.16_MorseCodeGenerator_zero.py

Once the program is running, you can input characters into the terminal. The buzzer and LED will output the corresponding Morse code signals.

----------------------------------------------

**Code**

Below is the Python code for this project:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    from gpiozero import Buzzer, LED
    import time

    # Initialize GPIO components
    BeepPin = Buzzer(22)
    ALedPin = LED(17)

    # Define Morse code dictionary
    MORSECODE = {
        'A': '01', 'B': '1000', 'C': '1010', 'D': '100', 'E': '0', 'F': '0010',
        'G': '110', 'H': '0000', 'I': '00', 'J': '0111', 'K': '101', 'L': '0100',
        'M': '11', 'N': '10', 'O': '111', 'P': '0110', 'Q': '1101', 'R': '010',
        'S': '000', 'T': '1', 'U': '001', 'V': '0001', 'W': '011', 'X': '1001',
        'Y': '1011', 'Z': '1100', '1': '01111', '2': '00111', '3': '00011',
        '4': '00001', '5': '00000', '6': '10000', '7': '11000', '8': '11100',
        '9': '11110', '0': '11111', '?': '001100', '/': '10010', ',': '110011',
        '.': '010101', ';': '101010', '!': '101011', '@': '011010', ':': '111000'
    }

    def on():
        """Turn on the buzzer and LED."""
        BeepPin.on()
        ALedPin.on()

    def off():
        """Turn off the buzzer and LED."""
        BeepPin.off()
        ALedPin.off()

    def beep(duration):
        """Emit a beep and flash for the specified duration."""
        on()
        time.sleep(duration)
        off()
        time.sleep(duration)

    def morsecode(message):
        """Convert and emit Morse code signals."""
        pause = 0.25
        for letter in message:
            if letter in MORSECODE:
                for symbol in MORSECODE[letter]:
                    beep(pause / 2 if symbol == '0' else pause)
                time.sleep(pause)

    try:
        while True:
            input_message = input("Enter message to convert to Morse code: ").upper()
            print(f"Input: {input_message}")
            morsecode(input_message)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Exiting program...")
        off()


This Python script converts a user-provided message into Morse code and signals it using a buzzer and LED. Here's how it works:

1. **Morse Code Conversion**: The script translates the input text (letters, numbers, and some special characters) into Morse code using a predefined dictionary ``MORSECODE``.

2. **Audio-Visual Morse Code Output**:

   - For each dot (``0``), the buzzer and LED are activated for a short duration (half of the pause time).
   - For each dash (``1``), the buzzer and LED are activated for a longer duration (equal to the pause time).

3. **User Interaction**:

   - Users input a message, and the system converts and emits the corresponding Morse code.
   - The program continuously asks for new messages until interrupted.

4. **Graceful Exit**: On ``Ctrl+C``, the script stops, turns off the buzzer and LED, and exits cleanly.

----------------------------------------------

**Understanding the Code**

1. **Components Setup:**  

   The buzzer and LED are initialized on GPIO pins 22 and 17, respectively.

2. **Morse Code Dictionary:**  

   Morse code is represented using '0' for dots (short signals) and '1' for dashes (long signals). For example, 'A' is represented as "01".

3. **Signal Functions:**  

   * The ``on()`` and ``off()`` functions activate or deactivate the buzzer and LED.  
   * The ``beep()`` function combines these to create a signal with a specified duration.  

4. **Morse Code Conversion:**  

   The ``morsecode()`` function processes each letter of the input message. It emits a series of signals for each character using the Morse code dictionary.

5. **Main Loop:**  

   The program continuously prompts for user input and converts the input to Morse code signals. The loop can be terminated safely with ``Ctrl+C``.


----------------------------------------------


**Troubleshooting**

1. **Buzzer or LED Does Not Work**:

   - **Cause**: Incorrect wiring or GPIO pin configuration.
   - **Solution**:

     - Verify the buzzer is connected to GPIO 22 and the LED to GPIO 17.
     - Test the buzzer and LED independently using simple GPIO control scripts.

2. **Morse Code Output Is Inaccurate**:

   - **Cause**: Input characters not in the ``MORSECODE`` dictionary.
   - **Solution**:

     - Ensure the input contains only supported characters (A-Z, 0-9, and select symbols).
     - Extend the ``MORSECODE`` dictionary to include additional characters.

3. **Fast or Overlapping Signals**:

   - **Cause**: Inadequate timing for pauses or signal durations.
   - **Solution**: Adjust the ``pause`` variable in the ``morsecode()`` function for clearer signaling:

       .. code-block:: python

           pause = 0.5  # Increase pause duration for slower output

4. **Input Not Detected**:

   - **Cause**: Input issues in the runtime environment (e.g., no console).
   - **Solution**: Ensure the script is run in a terminal or environment that supports ``input()``.

----------------------------------------------

**Extendable Ideas**

1. **Adjustable Speed**: Allow users to set the Morse code signaling speed by inputting a custom pause value.

     .. code-block:: python

         pause = float(input("Enter pause duration (seconds): "))

2. **Multi-Device Output**: Add another LED or buzzer to display the Morse code simultaneously on different devices.

3. **Morse Code Logging**: Log the Morse code sequence to a file for each message:

     .. code-block:: python

         with open("morse_log.txt", "a") as log_file:
             log_file.write(f"{message} -> {morse_sequence}\n")

4. **Real-Time Translation**: Display the Morse code as dots and dashes in the console during output.

5. **Input Validation**: Notify users if unsupported characters are included in the input.

6. **Interactive Features**: Add a mode where users can input Morse code (via a button) and decode it into text.

7. **Wireless Morse Communication**: Use RF modules to transmit Morse code signals wirelessly to another device.

----------------------------------------------

**Conclusion**

This project is a fun way to explore Morse code and its application using Raspberry Pi. By leveraging simple components like a buzzer and LED, you can create a system that bridges historical communication methods with modern electronics. Experiment with the code to enhance your understanding and make it your own!
