4.1.3 Magnetic Induction Alarm System
============================================

**Introduction**

Imagine you own a priceless vase and want to protect it. A magnetic induction alarm system is a great way to keep it safe. If anyone moves the vase, the alarm will notify you instantly! This project uses a reed switch and a buzzer to create a simple yet effective security system.

**Writing the Code**

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/zero-w-ai-kit/python

Run the code:

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 4.1.6_MagneticAlarmSystem_zero.py

When the reed switch is affected by a magnet (e.g., the reed switch is on the base and a magnet is inside the vase), the buzzer remains silent. If the magnet is removed (e.g., the vase is moved), the buzzer will emit a sound, alerting you to the disturbance.

**Code**

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   from gpiozero import Buzzer, Button
   import time

   # Initialize the buzzer on GPIO pin 27
   buzzer = Buzzer(27)
   # Initialize the reed switch on GPIO pin 17 with pull-up resistor enabled
   reed_switch = Button(17, pull_up=True)

   try:
       while True:
           # Check if the reed switch is pressed
           if reed_switch.is_pressed:
               # Turn off the buzzer if reed switch is pressed
               buzzer.off()
           else:
               # If reed switch is not pressed, beep the buzzer
               buzzer.on()
               time.sleep(0.1)  # Buzzer on for 0.1 seconds
               buzzer.off()
               time.sleep(0.1)  # Buzzer off for 0.1 seconds

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       # Turn off the buzzer when the program is interrupted (e.g., keyboard interrupt)
       buzzer.off()
       pass


This Python script integrates a reed switch and a buzzer to create a simple alarm system. When executed:

1. **Reed Switch Pressed**: The buzzer (connected to GPIO pin 27) is turned off when the reed switch (connected to GPIO pin 17) is pressed (indicating a closed circuit).

2. **Reed Switch Not Pressed**: The buzzer beeps intermittently (0.1 seconds on, 0.1 seconds off) when the reed switch is not pressed (indicating an open circuit).

3. **Continuous Monitoring**: The script continuously monitors the reed switch state and updates the buzzer behavior in real time.

4. **Graceful Exit**: On ``Ctrl+C`` or program interruption, the buzzer is turned off, and the program exits cleanly.


----------------------------------------------


**Understanding the Code**

#. Import necessary libraries: The ``gpiozero`` library provides classes for controlling GPIO pins, while the ``time`` module handles delays.

   .. code-block:: python

       from gpiozero import Buzzer, Button
       import time

#. Initialize the buzzer and reed switch:

   .. code-block:: python

       buzzer = Buzzer(27)
       reed_switch = Button(17, pull_up=True)

#. Monitor the reed switch state:

   - If the reed switch is pressed (magnet in place), the buzzer remains off.
   - If the reed switch is released (magnet removed), the buzzer beeps intermittently.

   .. code-block:: python

       if reed_switch.is_pressed:
           buzzer.off()
       else:
           buzzer.on()
           time.sleep(0.1)
           buzzer.off()
           time.sleep(0.1)

#. Graceful shutdown: Use a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` exception to ensure the buzzer is turned off when the program is interrupted.

   .. code-block:: python

       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           buzzer.off()
           pass


----------------------------------------------

**Troubleshooting**

1. **Buzzer Does Not Beep**:

   - **Cause**: Incorrect GPIO wiring or buzzer configuration.
   - **Solution**:

     - Verify the buzzer is connected to GPIO pin 27 and ground.
     - Ensure the buzzer is functional by testing it independently.

2. **Reed Switch Always Triggered**:

   - **Cause**: Faulty reed switch or incorrect wiring.
   - **Solution**:

     - Ensure the reed switch is properly connected to GPIO pin 17 and ground.
     - Test the reed switch with a multimeter to verify it closes the circuit when a magnet is near.

3. **Buzzer Stays On Constantly**:

   - **Cause**: Reed switch logic is inverted or misconfigured.
   - **Solution**: Confirm the reed switch's ``is_pressed`` state matches its wiring (pull-up resistor enabled).



----------------------------------------------

**Extendable Ideas**

1. **LED Indicator**: Add an LED to visually indicate the reed switch's state:

     .. code-block:: python

         from gpiozero import LED
         led = LED(22)
         if reed_switch.is_pressed:
             led.on()
         else:
             led.off()

2. **Event Logging**: Log the reed switch state changes with timestamps to a file:

     .. code-block:: python

         with open("reed_switch_log.txt", "a") as log_file:
             timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
             log_file.write(f"{timestamp} - Switch state: {'Pressed' if reed_switch.is_pressed else 'Not Pressed'}\n")

3. **Custom Buzzer Patterns**: Implement different buzzer patterns based on the reed switch state:

     .. code-block:: python

         def buzzer_pattern():
             for _ in range(3):
                 buzzer.on()
                 time.sleep(0.2)
                 buzzer.off()
                 time.sleep(0.2)
