Assemble the Fusion Hat 
====================================

Before executing the example, you can assemble the Fusion Hat and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W on the RAB Holder.

The RAB Holder is a base that can hold the Raspberry Pi ZERO 2 W, breadboard, and Fusion Hat. It can help you easily connect various sensors and actuators during the experiment and ensure the stability of the device.

Please follow the steps below to assemble.

1. Put the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W on the RAB Holder and fix it with screws.
