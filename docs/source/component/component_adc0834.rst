ADC0834
==============

ADC0834 is an 8-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter that is equipped with an input-configurable
multichannel multi-plexer and serial input/output. The serial
input/output is configured to interface with standard shift registers or
microprocessors.

**Sequence of Operation**

A conversion is initiated by setting CS low, which enables all logic
circuits. CS must be held low for the complete conversion process. A
clock input is then received from the processor. On each low-to-high
transition of the clock input, the data on DI is clocked into the
multiplexer address shift register. The first logic high on the input is
the start bit. A 3- to 4-bit assignment word follows the start bit. On
each successive low-to-high transition of the clock input, the start bit
and assignment word are shifted through the shift register. When the
start bit is shifted into the start location of the multiplexer
register, the input channel is selected and conversion starts. The SAR
Statu output (SARS) goes high to indicate that a conversion is in
progress, and DI to the multiplexer shift register is disabled the
duration of the conversion.

An interval of one clock period is automatically inserted to allow the
selected multiplexed channel to settle. The data output DO comes out of
the high-impedance state and provides a leading low for this one clock
period of multiplexer settling time. The SAR comparator compares
successive outputs from the resistive ladder with the incoming analog
signal. The comparator output indicates whether the analog input is
greater than or less than the resistive ladder output. As the conversion
proceeds, conversion data is simultaneously output from the DO output
pin, with the most significant bit (MSB) first.

After eight clock periods, the conversion is complete and the SARS
output goes low. Finally outputs the least-significant-bit-first data
after the MSB-first data stream.
