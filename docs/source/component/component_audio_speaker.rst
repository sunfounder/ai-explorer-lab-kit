Audio Module and Speaker
===========================

**Audio Amplifier Module**

Audio Amplifier Module contains a HXJ8002 audio power amplifier chip. This chip is a power amplifier with low power supply, that can provide 3W average audio power for a 3â„¦ BTL load with low harmonic distortion (under 10% threshold distortion at 1KHz) from a 5V DC power supply. This chip can amplify audio signals without any coupling capacitors or bootstrap capacitors.

The module can be supplied by a 2.0V up to 5.5V DC with 10mA operating current (0.6uA for typical standby current) power source and produce a powerful amplified sound into a 3Î©, 4Î©, or 8Î© impedance speaker. This module has an improved pop and clicks circuitry for reducing significantly the transition nose at the powering on and off moment. Tiny size besides high efficiency and low power supplying make it applicable in widely portable and battery-powered projects and microcontrollers.  


* **IC**: HXJ8002
* **Input Voltage**: 2V ~ 5.5V
* **Standby Mode Current**: 0.6uA (typical value)
* **Output Power**: 3W (3â„¦ load) , 2.5W (4â„¦ load) , 1.5W (8â„¦ load)
* **Output Speaker Impedance**: 3â„¦, 4â„¦, 8â„¦
* **Size**: 19.8mm x 14.2mm

This is a 3.5mm male audio cable with a total length of 43cm. it has 3 connectors, red for the left channel, white for the right channel, and GND in the middle.

**Circuit**

If your speaker have no sound, it may be because the Raspberry Pi has selected the wrong audio output (The default is HDMI), you need to :ref:`change_audio_output` to **Headphones**.

If you feel that the volume of the speakers is too low, you can :ref:`adjust_volume`.
