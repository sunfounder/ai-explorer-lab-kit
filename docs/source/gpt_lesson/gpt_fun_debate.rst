2.4 Debate Simulation
======================================

This Python script simulates a debate between two GPT-based assistants: one playing the role of an affirmative speaker and the other as the opposition. The program uses hardware elements such as a servo motor and LEDs to visually represent the debate and integrates text-to-speech for auditory feedback.

The program integrates text-to-speech, servo motor movement, and LED lighting to enhance the interactive experience, providing a realistic simulation of a debate scenario.


----------------------------------------------

**Features**

1. **Interactive Debate**:

   * Two AI assistants, one affirmative and one opposition, engage in a structured debate.
   * Alternating turns with clearly defined roles and instructions for each assistant.

2. **Speech Synthesis**:

   * Converts AI-generated responses into audible speech using OpenAI's TTS model.
   * Separate voices for each assistant for clarity and realism.

3. **Hardware Integration**:

   * Servo motor movement visually indicates the active speaker.
   * LEDs light up to represent the affirmative (LED 1) or opposition (LED 2) speaker.

4. **Customizable Topics**:

   * User-provided input serves as the debate topic.
   * AI generates arguments and counterarguments dynamically.

5. **Resource Cleanup**:

   * Ensures proper deactivation of hardware and API resources after use.

**Code Explanation**

1. Initialization

.. code-block:: python

   import openai
   from keys import OPENAI_API_KEY
   import readline  # Optimize keyboard input, only need to import
   import sys,os
   from pathlib import Path
   from fusion_hat import Servo, Pin
   import subprocess

Importing Required Libraries:

* ``openai``: Interacts with GPT and TTS models.
* ``fusion_hat``: Controls GPIO-connected hardware (servo motor, LEDs).
* ``subprocess``: Plays audio files generated by the TTS model.

.. code-block:: python

   CORRECTION = 0.45
   MAX_PW = (2.0 + CORRECTION) / 1000
   MIN_PW = (1.0 - CORRECTION) / 1000

   servo = Servo(5, min_pulse_width=MIN_PW, max_pulse_width=MAX_PW)
   led1 = LED(23)
   led2 = LED(24)
   led1.off()
   led2.off()

Hardware Configuration:

* Servo Motor: Adjusted with fine-tuned pulse widths for precise movements.
* LEDs: Indicate the active speaker.

.. code-block:: python

   client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

OpenAI Initialization:

* Creates an OpenAI client using an API key stored in the ``keys.py`` file.

2. Assistant Creation

.. code-block:: python

   assistants = [
      client.beta.assistants.create(
         name="Alloy",
         instructions=(
               "You are a debate team affirmative speaker. You must agree with the "
               "proposed viewpoint, provide reasonable arguments, and respond to opposition "
               "criticism. Each response should start with the phrase 'This is affirmative response #X' "
               "and must be under 100 words."
         ),
         model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
      ),
      client.beta.assistants.create(
         name="Echo",
         instructions=(
               "You are a debate team opposition speaker. You must refute the affirmative's arguments "
               "using logical reasoning and references. Each response should start with the phrase 'This is opposition response #X' "
               "and must be under 100 words."
         ),
         model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
      ),
   ]

* Alloy: Represents the affirmative speaker.
* Echo: Represents the opposition speaker.
* Each assistant has specific instructions for generating concise responses.

3. Debate Logic

      """
      Handle the debate flow for a single turn.

      except Exception as e:
         print(f"Error during debate: {e}")
         return "An error occurred. Please try again."

Debate Function:

* Sends the user's statement to the assistant.
* Retrieves and processes the assistant's response.
* Calls ``play_response()`` to synthesize and play the response.

Text-to-Speech Function:

* Saves the audio file for playback.


4. Main Loop

.. code-block:: python

   # Create a thread for the debate
   thread = client.beta.threads.create()

   try:
      print("Start the debate by entering your topic:")
      msg = input(f'\033[1;30m{"Input: "}\033[0m').strip()
      if not msg:

         msg = debate(turn % 2, msg)

   finally:
      # Cleanup GPIO and OpenAI resources
      servo.mid()
      servo.close()
      led1.off()
      led1.close()
      led2.off()
      led2.close()
      for assistant in assistants:
         client.beta.assistants.delete(assistant.id)
      print("Resources cleaned up. Exiting.")

* Alternates between affirmative and opposition speakers for six turns.
* Cleans up hardware resources and deletes assistant instances after completion.


----------------------------------------------

**Debugging Tips**

1. Servo and LEDs Not Working:

   * Verify GPIO connections and pin configurations.
   * Ensure proper power supply to the components.

2. Speech Not Playing:

   * Check if mplayer is installed (sudo apt install mplayer).
   * Ensure the TTS API is generating valid audio files.

3. OpenAI Errors:

   * Verify your API key and internet connection.
   * Check for API usage limits in your OpenAI account.

4. Unexpected Assistant Responses:

   * Debug by printing raw responses: print(response).
   * Ensure the assistant instructions are clear and concise.
