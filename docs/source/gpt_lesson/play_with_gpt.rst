Play with GPT
===========================

In the current technological trend, the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) is growing, especially in the field of natural language processing (NLP). 
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, which can understand and generate human-like text, and is widely used in many fields from automatic writing to customer service.
This tutorial aims to introduce interested developers, students, and technology enthusiasts how to deploy and use the GPT model on a small computing device such as Raspberry Pi.

Before carrying out the projects in this section, it is best to have completed the learning of :ref:`play_with_python`.
